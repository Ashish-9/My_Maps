# Development of Open Api for integration with BharatMap
The project is an android based application that communicates with the server with Json request and response. The main objective of this application is to collect data by capturing images and location along with other parameters and upload them to the server of BharatMap. The application is required to work in remote locations as well, without internet connectivity. 

•	The proposed system has two users: Admin and Application user.

•	In the proposed system the admin creates the user, who then logs into the android application.

•	The admin can add or delete users and view the uploads of the user.

•	The android application user can upload the image either by capturing or selecting an image from the gallery along with locations and other parameters.

•	The user first needs to login to the application to access it. The user can also change its name, profile picture and password.

•	The application has a dark mode and a material design, which gives it a modern look. Also, it is available in multiple languages viz Assamese, Hindi & English.

•	The application will provide an alternative to Google Maps in the near future and boost the ‘Make in India’ campaign of the Indian government.
